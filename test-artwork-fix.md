# Artwork Display Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The issue was that downloaded songs' artwork was not displaying in the fullscreen music player, even though:
1. The artwork was downloaded and available at the correct path
2. Song cards were showing the artwork correctly
3. The logs showed the same track being processed multiple times

## Root Causes Found

### 1. Async Function Called Synchronously
- The `safeExists` function is async but was being called synchronously in `useDynamicArtwork`
- This caused file existence checks to fail, falling back to default images

### 2. Multiple Hook Calls
- The `getArtworkSourceFromHook` function was being called multiple times in the same component
- This caused excessive logging and performance issues

### 3. Improper Artwork Handling Priority
- The hook was checking local files before checking the track's artwork property
- For downloaded songs, the artwork property should be prioritized

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed useDynamicArtwork Hook (`hooks/useDynamicArtwork.js`)
- Added proper async file checking with caching
- Prioritized track's artwork property for downloaded songs
- Added memoization to prevent excessive re-renders
- Implemented file existence caching to avoid repeated checks

### 2. Optimized FullScreenMusic Component (`Component/MusicPlayer/FullScreenMusic.jsx`)
- Added memoization for artwork source to prevent multiple hook calls
- Replaced multiple `getArtworkSourceFromHook(currentPlaying)` calls with single memoized value
- Updated AlbumArtworkDisplay to use pre-computed artwork source

### 3. Updated AlbumArtworkDisplay Component (`Component/MusicPlayer/AlbumArtworkDisplay.jsx`)
- Changed to accept pre-computed artwork source instead of calling hook function
- Eliminated redundant artwork source computation

## Expected Results
1. Downloaded songs should now display their artwork in fullscreen player
2. Reduced excessive logging (from 12+ identical logs to minimal logging)
3. Better performance due to memoization and caching
4. Consistent artwork display across all components

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with downloaded songs that have artwork
2. Verify artwork displays in both song cards and fullscreen player
3. Check that performance is improved (less logging)
4. Test with different artwork formats (jpg, png, gif)

## Technical Details
- The hook now properly handles `sourceType: 'downloaded'` tracks
- File existence checks are cached to avoid repeated filesystem operations
- Artwork source is memoized based on track ID, artwork, isLocal, and sourceType
- Priority order: track.artwork → local files → fallback images
