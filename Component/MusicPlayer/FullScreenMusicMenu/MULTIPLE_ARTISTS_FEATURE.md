# Multiple Artists Support in Three-Dot Menu

## üé§ Feature Overview

When a song has multiple artists, the three-dot menu now intelligently displays separate "More from [Artist Name]" options for each artist, giving users the choice of which specific artist profile to view instead of defaulting to only the first artist.

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Artist Data Detection

The system detects multiple artists from various data structures:

#### Method 1: `artists.primary` Array (Preferred)
```javascript
song.artists = {
  primary: [
    { id: "arijit-singh-1", name: "Arijit Singh" },
    { id: "pritam-1", name: "Pritam" },
    { id: "shreya-ghoshal-1", name: "Shreya Ghoshal" }
  ]
}
```

#### Method 2: Artist String Parsing
```javascript
song.artist = "Arijit Singh feat. Shreya Ghoshal & Rahat Fateh Ali Khan"
// Parsed into: ["Arijit Singh", "Shreya Ghoshal", "Rahat Fateh Ali Khan"]
```

#### Method 3: Fallback to Single Artist
```javascript
song.artist = "Arijit Singh"
song.artistID = "arijit-singh-1"
```

### Key Functions

#### `extractMultipleArtists(song)`
- Extracts all artists from song data
- Returns array of artist objects with `id`, `name`, and `type`
- Handles various data formats and edge cases

#### `navigateToSpecificArtist(artistId, artistName)`
- Navigates to a specific artist's page
- Includes search fallback if artist ID is missing
- Maintains navigation breadcrumbs

#### `addMoreFromSpecificArtist(artistId, artistName)`
- Shows more songs from a specific artist
- Uses multiple API strategies for reliability
- Provides user feedback and error handling

### Menu Generation Logic

```javascript
const getMenuOptions = () => {
  const artists = extractMultipleArtists(currentPlaying);
  
  if (artists.length <= 1) {
    // Single artist: show normal menu
    return [
      { text: 'Go to Album', onPress: navigateToAlbum },
      { text: 'Go to Artist', onPress: navigateToArtist },
      { text: `More from ${artist.name}`, onPress: addMoreFromArtist },
      { text: 'Add to Playlist', onPress: addToPlaylist }
    ];
  } else {
    // Multiple artists: show individual options
    return [
      { text: 'Go to Album', onPress: navigateToAlbum },
      ...artists.map(artist => ({
        text: `More from ${artist.name}`,
        onPress: () => addMoreFromSpecificArtist(artist.id, artist.name)
      })),
      { text: 'Add to Playlist', onPress: addToPlaylist }
    ];
  }
};
```

## üß™ Testing

### Test Data Available

```javascript
// Multiple artists with primary array
TEST_SONGS.MULTIPLE_ARTISTS_PRIMARY = {
  artists: {
    primary: [
      { id: "arijit-singh-1", name: "Arijit Singh" },
      { id: "pritam-1", name: "Pritam" },
      { id: "shreya-ghoshal-1", name: "Shreya Ghoshal" },
      { id: "amitabh-bhattacharya-1", name: "Amitabh Bhattacharya" }
    ]
  }
};

// Multiple artists with string parsing
TEST_SONGS.MULTIPLE_ARTISTS_STRING = {
  artist: "Arijit Singh feat. Shreya Ghoshal & Rahat Fateh Ali Khan"
};
```

### Testing Scenarios

1. **Single Artist Song**: Should show normal menu with single artist options
2. **Multiple Artists (Primary Array)**: Should show individual "More from [Artist]" for each
3. **Multiple Artists (String)**: Should parse and show individual options
4. **Missing Artist Data**: Should gracefully handle and show generic options
5. **Artist ID Missing**: Should trigger search fallback for each artist

## üé® UI/UX Considerations

### Menu Length Management
- Maximum 6-7 menu items to prevent overflow
- Long artist names are truncated with ellipsis
- Maintains consistent icon usage (üë§ for artists)

### User Feedback
- Toast messages indicate which artist page is opening
- Loading states for search operations
- Clear error messages for failed operations

### Performance
- Lazy evaluation of artist data
- Cached search results to prevent duplicate API calls
- Efficient menu re-rendering only when song changes

## üîç Debugging

### Enhanced Logging
```javascript
console.log('üé§ Extracted artists:', [
  { id: "arijit-singh-1", name: "Arijit Singh", type: "primary" },
  { id: "pritam-1", name: "Pritam", type: "primary" },
  { id: "shreya-ghoshal-1", name: "Shreya Ghoshal", type: "primary" }
]);
```

### Development Tools
- Test menu option in development mode
- Comprehensive song structure analysis
- Artist extraction validation

## üöÄ Benefits

1. **User Choice**: Users can choose which specific artist to explore
2. **Better Discovery**: Easier access to all collaborating artists
3. **Accurate Navigation**: No more defaulting to just the first artist
4. **Consistent UX**: Maintains familiar three-dot menu interface
5. **Robust Fallbacks**: Works even with incomplete artist data

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

- Maintains existing single-artist functionality
- Legacy functions still work for existing code
- No breaking changes to existing menu behavior
- Graceful degradation for songs without artist data

## üì± Real-World Examples

### Bollywood Collaboration
Song: "Tum Hi Ho" by Arijit Singh, Mithoon, Shreya Ghoshal
Menu shows:
- More from Arijit Singh
- More from Mithoon  
- More from Shreya Ghoshal

### Western Pop Collaboration
Song: "Stay" by The Kid LAROI & Justin Bieber
Menu shows:
- More from The Kid LAROI
- More from Justin Bieber

This feature significantly enhances music discovery and provides users with the flexibility to explore any artist involved in a song, not just the primary one.
